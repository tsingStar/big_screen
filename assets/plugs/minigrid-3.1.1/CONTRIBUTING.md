**Be nice** 😎

Bare in mind that minigrid's main concept is simplicity. The goal is to keep the API always at 2kb. Bug fixes are more than welcome! For any new feature please [submit an issue](https://github.com/henriquea/minigrid/issues) first before send any pull request.

🍺

## Tests

All commits must pass the tests `npm run test`.

Install browserify and testling globally.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install browserify -g
$ npm install testling -g
```

## Build

The build task `npm run build` runs the tests and does the minification.
